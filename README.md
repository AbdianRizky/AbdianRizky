### 1. 🧑Personality

Ok, so his full name is **Abdian Rizky Ramadan** usually called **Adon** by his family and friends. he was born in Bekasi on November 10, 2003, and in 2010 he moved to Bojonggede, Bogor which is now his current residence. As a child he _dreamed_ of becoming an Indonesian soldier but he realized that in the future technology would develop very rapidly so he changed his dream to become an **IT Professional** who can change and advance of his nation, country and family even the world if that is possible. So, in order to do that I will take every opportunity, risk and knowledge that can make me an IT Professional.
